## Overview

- Why data viz? 
- Types of viz
- Best practices
- What to watch for when reading viz or avoid when creating viz

## Why Data Viz?

Communicating data

-	Raw data
-	Summaries of raw data, reports
- Results of predictive models

Data analysts use it in every step of the data analysis workflow:

- Data is the foundation, but is often messy, so use viz while collecting, organizing, merging, checking etc., data sets. Identify outliers and potential inaccurate data
- Assess the results of models
- Checking your work every step
- etc

```{r  out.width = "80%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/TB Attendance.jpg') 
```

```{r  out.width = "80%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/MIN Attendance.jpg') 
```

## Why not just use a table?
-	Tables of numbers can be used for those similar purposes, often effectively.  Viz can often convey the most important information more quickly and easily

- Often relative relationships are more important than exact numbers
    +	If exact numbers are important, they can go in a table or can sometimes be shown in viz (e.g. `geom_text`)

-	Some relationships are difficult to express in a table
    +	Spatial relationships (location)
    + Temporal relationships (time)
    + Spatial temporal relationships (location and time)
  
## Spatial: Sales by Zip Code 

- Table with two columns
  + zip code
  + number of customers (or revenue, or tickets, etc.)
  
- Lose spatial information
  + What zip codes are adjacent?
  + Neighborhoods, highways, landmarks
  + Table is not as intuitive

```{r  out.width="25%", echo=F, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics('img/South FL map - just 1st one.png') 
```

## Temporal: New COVID Cases By Date

```{r echo=F}
d = read.csv('data/owid-covid-data.csv')
dg = d %>% 
  filter(location=='United States') %>% 
  select(date, new_cases) %>%
  filter(date >= '2020-09-01') %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%
  head(12)
print(dg,row.names = F)
```
\pause 

No obvious trends.

## Temporal: New COVID Cases By Date

```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/New COVID Cases By Date.jpg') 
```

## Temporal: Sales by Event Date

```{r, echo=F}
d = readRDS('data/mlb.attendance.data.rds')
dg = d %>% 
  filter(season==max(season))%>%
  select(date, away, home, attendance) %>%
  head(12)
print(dg, row.names=F)
```
\pause 
No obvious weekly trends.

## Temporal: Sales by Event Date

```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/MLB Attendance with rolling average.jpg') 
```
	

## Types of viz

- Bar
- Line 
- Scatter
- Histogram
- Heat map

## Bar chart 
- Or "bar graph", "bar plot"
- Categorical data
- Bar for each category, length of bar according to some value
- Example: Alcohol use by age
    + Age ranges - categorical
    + Percentage of those in range who used in the past 12 months - value used as length of the bars 
    
## Bar chart 

```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Alcohol Use By Age.jpg') 
```
	

##	Line chart 

- Or "line graph", "line plot"
- Often used to display trends in numeric data over time
- Example: New COVID Cases By Date

\pause

```{r  out.width = "50%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/New COVID Cases By Date.jpg') 
```

## Line Chart
- If there aren't many data points, can show points too. 
- Example: Player rating over time
    + Year - the measure of time
    + Player rating - numeric data we want to the trend for
    
\pause

```{r  out.width = "40%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/LeBron and Giannis with image.jpg') 
```

## Scatter plot
- Display the relationship between two numeric variables in a data set
- Example: Cost vs Interventions for heart disease patients
    + Interventions - numeric
    + Total cost - also numeric

## Scatter plot

```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Cost vs Interventions.jpg') 
```

## Scatter plot

```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Cost vs Interventions - Transparency.jpg') 
```

## Scatter plot
```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Cost vs Interventions - Transparency, Log Scales.jpg') 
```

## Scatter plot
```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Cost vs Interventions - Transparency, Log Scales, Jitter.jpg') 
```

## Scatter plot
```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Cost vs Interventions - with trend line.jpg') 
```


## Scatter plot
- Size or color dots based on other information
\pause
```{r  out.width = "90%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Map of Inital Hubs and Confirmed Partners.png') 
```


## Histogram
- Numeric data (unlike categorical data for bar plot)
- Shows ranges of values, how often they occur
- Different than bar chart (which was for categorical data)

## Histogram

```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Distribution of the Number of Interventions.jpg') 
```

## Heat maps
Use color to show magnitude of numeric data over 2 dimensions

\pause

```{r  out.width = "80%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/South FL maps.png') 
```

## Heat maps

```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Hospital Ratings in PA.jpg') 
```

## Heat maps

```{r  out.width = "100%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Hospital Ratings By State - flipped.jpg') 
```

## Best practices

- Ensure viz answers a question, highlights an observation, serves some academic or business purpose
-	Simple, to the point. 
    + Use types of charts people are familiar with and can understand easily, highlight main takeaways
    + Avoid distracting colors and unnecessary features from the main takeaways
    + Avoid TMI.

-	Use color wisely
    +	draw attention to main takeaway(s)
    + separate context/background data and the data of interest
    +	indicate different categories

## Best practices

- Label well
    +	Title - always
    + Axes - very often
    + Legend - when applicable

-	Give context
    +	What is average? 
    +	What is a normal range? 
    +	What was it last year?

- Show uncertainty when possible/appropriate
- Show dots (raw data) when possible

## Best practices {.smaller}

Consider the audience and platform. May want different versions depending on the audience/platform/medium.

- can have more/fewer details
- highlight different things. Key takeaways may be different

Audience

- Advisor, Manager
- Research group, Analytics team
- Customers
- Media, Social media

Platform

- Written documents on computer
- Written documents on paper
- Slides, Video
- Social media

  
## What to watch for (when reading) and avoid (when creating) viz

Viz with no clear takeaway

- Is the chart showing relevant and appropriate information? 
- Does it answer a question appropriately? 
- Is the metric appropriate? Should it be a rate or percentage instead of a count?


## Pay attention to axes
-	Axes that donâ€™t start at zero
    +	This can be the default in some software packages
    +	Can give misleading differences in bar lengths
    +	Ex: Treatment vs placebo comparison

\pause 

```{r  out.width = "90%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Treatment and Placebo.jpg') 
```

## Pay attention to axes
-	Broken axes
  	+ Misleading differences in bars, for example
-	Scale of axes
    + What is the range of values? Very small or large?
    + Is log scale being used?

\pause

```{r  out.width = "40%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Cost vs Interventions - Transparency, Log Scales, Jitter.jpg') 
```

##	Sample size and potential impacts
- If a result looks weird, could it be a sample size issue? 
-	Different sized bins, different sized groups when binned
    +	Ex. Drug use by age 
    
\pause

```{r  out.width = "50%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/Alcohol Use By Age.jpg') 
```



## Inappropriate choice of viz type

- Line chart with categorical data on horizontal axes
    + Bar chart is probably better
-	Pie charts 
    +	Use for proportions. 
    + Even with proportions, can be tough to compare categories
    + Can you use a bar chart?

## Inappropriate choice of viz type

-	Radar charts
    +	Areas can be misleading, have no meaning
    + Difficult to compare categories
    + Can you use a bar chart?

\pause

```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
include_graphics('img/SpiderChartWikipedia.jpg') 
```
    
## Inappropriate choice of viz type
- 3D bar chart
    +	Unnecessary third dimension can yield misleading bar heights
    + Adds clutter/distraction, provides no information
    + Can you use a (2D) bar chart?  
-	Stacked bars
    +	In some cases, appropriate
    + In some cases, tough to compare
    +	Can you use separate bar charts?

## Stacked bars
```{r out.width="60%", echo=F}
## created by manually saving in RStudio
include_graphics('img/Drug Use By Age - Stacked bars.jpeg') 
```

## Alternative
```{r  out.width = "50%", echo=F}
## created by manually saving in RStudio
include_graphics('img/Drug Use By Age - Faceted.jpg') 
```



## Difficult to distinguish colors

-	Too many colors, difficult to distinguish. 
-	Colors that are not colorblind-friendly
    +	Choose a different palette, or 
    + Use different shapes (e.g. circles, squares, diamonds) or lines (e.g. solid, dotted, dashed) to further distinguish 
    
Note: 5% of the population (mostly male) is Red-Green colorblind

- Avoid red and green together, without other ways to distinguish. 
- Green/Yellow/Red is a frequently-used color palette.  

## Not Colorblind friendly
```{r out.width = "70%", echo=F}
## created by manually saving in RStudio
include_graphics('img/Drug Use By Age - Stacked bars.jpeg') 
```

## Colorblind friendly
```{r  out.width = "70%", echo=F}
## created by manually saving in RStudio
include_graphics('img/Drug Use By Age - Colorblind friendly.jpeg') 
```

## Interactive visualization

Want the option of more information, but don't want to clutter the viz. 

Show information on hover


## Animation

Want to show trends in data over time, but line plot is too simple.

Example: Player and ball locations over time, 25 times a second.
Impossible to process by looking at the data set.

```{r out.width="70%"}
include_graphics('img/bball.locations.gif')
```

## Recap {.smaller}

Visualization is for understanding and communicating data, and it ideally

- answers a question,
- highlights a key observation or takeaway from analysis,
- summarizes important information, 
- helps analysts understand data and identify problems, or 
- serves some other purpose,

does those

- clearly, and
- concisely

and is appropriate for 

- the intended audience
- the intended platform

## Discussion

- What is the purpose?

  + What is the question you are trying to answer? 

- Who is the audience? 

  + Is your visualization appropriate for this audience?

- In what context will they see this visualization?
- What is the key observation or takeaway? 

  + Is that obvious from a quick look at the visualization? 
  + Can color or labeling be used to highlight the main takeaway?
    
- Does the visualization have unnecessary features that distract from the main takeaway?
